# Coursera-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-All-Assignment
In the course, I learnt the foundations of deep learning.Following are the topics and new things I learnt:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

Almost every topic is also implemented...!
Starting from week 1 to week 4...!
